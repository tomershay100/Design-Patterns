# Design-Patterns
Implementations in C++ of various Design Patterns, operator overloading, vector data structure (from the STL library), iterator and functions from the algorithms library in C++.
Each file is a stand-alone implementation. Briefings:
* Factory (Design Pattern)
* Bridge (Design Pattern)
* Builder (Design Pattern)
* Command (Design Pattern)
* Decorator (Design Pattern)
* Flyweight (Design Pattern)
* Observer (Design Pattern)
* MyVector class with iterator implementation and some algorithm's function (e.g. ```for_each()```, ```count_if()```, ```find()``` and more).
* Integer class (like Integer class in Java) with implementations of operators such as ++, =, *=, >, != etc.
* Graph class with implementation of C'TOR, Copy C'TOR, D'TOR, Move C'TOR and operator=.
* Point class that combines flyweight and singleton design patterns.
and more.
